      <director>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford; Pitt also stars in the film</director>
      <director>as James. The year 2007 found Pitt involved</director>

      <director>in a number of increasingly intelligent and distinguished projects. He signed on to reteam with David Fincher for the first occasion since Fight Club</director>
      <director>with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button - a bittersweet fantasy</director>
      <director>adapted by Forrest Gump scribe Eric Roth from an F. Scott Fitzgerald story</director>

      <director>then did some of the most highly-praised work of his career as a disciplinarian father in Terence Malick's The Tree of Life (2011) - a sprawling</director>
      <director>cerebral phantasmorgia on the meaning of life and death that became one of the critical sensations of the year. He also won a great deal of praise for his turn as Billy Beane in Bennett Miller's adaptation of the non-fiction book Moneyball</director>
      <director>a role that not only earned him critical raves but Best Actor nominations from the Academy</director>
      <director>BAFTA</director>
      <director>the Broadcast Film Association</director>
      <director>the Golden Globes</director>
      <director>and won him the New York Film Critics Circle award (though the institution also recognized his work in Tree of Life as figuring into their decision).In 2013</director>
      <director>Pitt's Plan B production company produced 12 Years a Slave (he also appeared in the film</director>
      <director>in a small supporting role)</director>
      <director>which earned Pitt an Academy Award when the film won Best Picture. The next year</director>
      <director>Pitt won an Emmy as part of the producing team of the HBO tv movie The Normal Heart.      Brendan Gleeson (Actor)     Born:  March 29</director>
      <director>1955 in Dublin</director>
      <director>Ireland    Trivia:  A former teacher</director>
      <director>burly Irish actor Brendan Gleeson spent the 1990s earning an increasing amount of acclaim for his work in a variety of films</director>
      <director>most notably John Boorman's The General (1998). Gleeson</director>
      <director>who made his feature film debut in Jim Sheridan's The Field (1990)</director>
      <director>first made an impression on audiences in the role of Hamish</director>
      <director>William Wallace's hulking ally in Braveheart (1995).In 1997</director>
      <director>the actor was given his first crack at a starring role in I Went Down</director>
      <director>a likeable black comedy that cast him as a thick-skulled hitman. The role brought him a greater dose of recognition and respect on both sides of the Atlantic</director>
      <director>but it was Boorman's The General (shot right after I Went Down wrapped) that truly demanded -- and received -- international attention. The story of real-life Irish criminal Martin Cahill</director>
      <director>the film featured Gleeson in its title role</director>
      <director>and his cocky</director>
      <director>assured portrayal of Cahill was widely deemed the best part of an altogether excellent film. The numerous plaudits he won for his performance included awards from Boston and London film critics.His career flourishing</director>
      <director>it was only a matter of time before Gleeson had the opportunity to expand his resumé to include the occasional Hollywood blockbuster. That opportunity came by way of John Woo's Mission: Impossible 2 (2000)</director>
      <director>which cast Gleeson</director>
      <director>surprisingly enough</director>
      <director>as one of the film's resident villains. After carefully balancing his roles between the mainstream and the more low-key</director>
      <director>character-driven films in later 2000 and into 2001 (he gained notice for his starring role as a philanderous</director>
      <director>boozing TV chef turned sensitive amnesiac in the romantic comedy Wild About Harry [2000])</director>

      <director>it wasn't long before Gleeson was once again gracing stateside cinemas with appearances in such high-profile films as Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002) and the Kurt Russell police detective thriller Dark Blue (2003).Gleeson remained a presence in high-profile films over the ensuing two years. In 2004 he could be seen in both the M. Night Shyamalan brain-bender The Village and the sweeping historical epic Troy. The following year found the actor in another pair of big-budget Hollywood films</director>
      <director>the box-office dud Kingdom of Heaven and the fourth installment in the Harry Potter franchise</director>
      <director>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

Two years later he returned as Mad Eye for the final Harry Potter movie. That same year he turned in one of his best performances in The Guard. He played opposite the Oscar nominated Glenn Close in Albert Nobbs in 2011</director>
      <director>and enjoyed roles in a couple of high-profile Hollywood films - The Raven and Safe House the next year.      Rose Byrne (Actor)     Born:  July 24</director>
      <director>1979 in Sydney</director>
      <director>New South Wales</director>
      <director>Australia    Trivia:  Though Australian-born actress Rose Byrne made her film debut in 1994</director>
      <director>when she played a supporting role in the eccentric drama Dallas Doll alongside Sandra Bernhard and Jake Blundell</director>
      <director>her breakout performances within her native country were both on the small screen; namely</director>

      <director>England    Trivia:  Before enrolling in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</director>
      <director>Sean Bean was going to enter his father's Sheffield steel fabrication business as a welder. He changed his mind after he garnered praise for acting in a few roles in local theater while taking an art class at Rotherham College. Bean received a scholarship to the prestigious academy and graduated a few years later with the Silver Medal for his performance in Waiting for Godot. Shortly thereafter</director>
      <director>Bean performed in several West End productions. He also appeared in Romeo and Juliet with the Glasgow Citizens Theatre and with the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-upon-Avon. In the first he played Tybalt and in the second he played Romeo. Following more stage experience</director>

      <director>after returning to the stage</director>
      <director>Bean appeared in Mike Figgis' Stormy Monday and in another Jarman effort</director>
      <director>War Requiem. In addition to his filmwork</director>
      <director>Bean also has a thriving television career that began in the mid-'80s. Notable television work includes Clarissa (1992) and Sharpe (1993). It is as a "bad guy" in films such as Patriot Games and Golden Eye that Bean is best-known in the U.S.</director>

      <director>1968 in Melbourne</director>
      <director>Victoria</director>
      <director>Australia    Trivia:  A popular and easygoing Australian comedian whose keen adaptability lent itself well to aggressive-oriented early film roles</director>
      <director>Eric Bana's hatred of firearms may seem ironic in contrast to the Aussie funnyman's fledgling film portrayals of real-life mass murderer (and popular cult celebrity figure in the land Down Under) Mark "Chopper" Read (Chopper [2000]) and a military man caught in heated battle on a rescue mission (Black Hawk Down [2001]). Born and raised in Melbourne</director>
      <director>Australia</director>
      <director>Bana's career as a comedian began while working as a bartender at his native city's Castle Hotel in 1991. Television offers began flowing in a few short years later</director>
      <director>and in 1993</director>
      <director>Bana took his sharp wit to the small screen as he assumed the roles of both writer and performer on one of Australia's top comedy programs</director>
      <director>Full Frontal. His star on the rise</director>
      <director>the increasingly popular comedian made audiences laugh even harder when he co-produced and starred in his own 1996 comedy special Eric (later to become a series) and kicked off The Eric Bana Show Live the following year. 1997 proved to be a busy year for Bana as he also made his feature debut in The Castle</director>
      <director>though all of his hard work would pay off when he took a feature role in Australian television's Something in the Air in 2000 and was voted Australia's Most Popular Comedy Performer at the Logies. Bana next took on the role of notorious Aussie author/murderer Mark "Chopper" Read in Chopper (2000). Hollywood was soon calling for Bana</director>
      <director>and he answered by accepting a role in the tense true story of the Battle of Mogadishu</director>
      <director>Black Hawk Down</director>
      <director>followed by the title role in Ang Lee's The Hulk. While Lee's adaptation of the comic would be universally panned</director>
      <director>Bana continued his upward trajectory</director>
      <director>playing a major role in the acclaimed film Munich</director>
      <director>playing the head of the squadron assigned to avenge the murder of Israeli athletes at the 172 Olympics. He then showcased his range by playing opposite Drew Barrymore in the Curtis Hanson film Lucky You</director>

      <director>like Star Trek</director>
      <director>Funny People</director>
      <director>The Time Traveler's Wife</director>
      <director>Hanna</director>
      <director>and Deadfall.      Orlando Bloom (Actor)     Born:  January 13</director>
      <director>1977 in Canterbury</director>
      <director>England    Trivia:  Orlando Bloom began reading J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a teenager before abandoning the books in favor of sports and girls. He did not complete the three volumes until his early twenties: first in print</director>
      <director>and then on camera as one of a handful of actors carefully selected for New Line Cinema's highly anticipated</director>
      <director>$270 million</director>
      <director>three-film screen adaptation of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The international success of the trilogy's first installment</director>
      <director>The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)</director>
      <director>made Bloom a sought-after young actor. The talented Brit works the talk show circuit</director>
      <director>mugs in magazines</director>
      <director>and appears at every important award show -- always with a playful demeanor and an uncorrupted smile that suggest he could still be just as easily fulfilled by rugby and romance. Bloom was raised in Canterbury</director>
      <director>Kent</director>
      <director>with his sister</director>
      <director>Samantha. Their mother taught them to enjoy the arts and encouraged them to participate in the local Kent Festival. Bloom began by reciting poetry and prose</director>
      <director>displaying an advanced sensitivity to tone and modulation. Yet</director>
      <director>it wasn't this precociousness or his frequent trips to the theater that influenced Bloom to become a professional actor. He was in awe of larger-than-life characters -- from Superman to the members of the A-Team -- and knew the only way to become one was to play one on the screen. At 16</director>
      <director>Bloom relocated to London and performed with the National Youth Theatre for two seasons before winning a scholarship to train with the British American Drama Academy. At the conclusion of his term with the group</director>
      <director>he played the lead in A Walk in the Vienna Woods</director>
      <director>and secured an agent. This led to small roles on British television and an appearance in Brian Gilbert's Wilde (1997). Wishing to further his education</director>
      <director>Bloom then enrolled at London's prestigious Guildhall School of Music and Drama (the alma mater of Ewan McGregor</director>
      <director>Joseph Fiennes</director>
      <director>and Ben Chaplin</director>
      <director>among others). There</director>
      <director>he acted in several plays</director>
      <director>including Shakespeare's Twelfth Night</director>
      <director>Chekov's Three Sisters</director>
      <director>and Sophocles' Antigone. While still in school</director>
      <director>Bloom was trying to make it onto a friend's rooftop terrace when he fell three stories and broke his back. The accident almost paralyzed the actor</director>
      <director>but surgery let him walk out of the hospital on crutches. Soon afterward</director>
      <director>all his peers auditioned for coveted roles in the upcoming The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The extensive and selective casting process took place in every English-speaking country. Bloom good-naturedly tried out for the role of Faramir</director>
      <director>a character introduced in the second film</director>
      <director>The Two Towers (2002). After meeting with the project's director</director>
      <director>Peter Jackson</director>
      <director>Bloom was not cast as Faramir. Instead</director>
      <director>Jackson asked that he read for the part of Legolas Greenleaf</director>
      <director>a much more prominent figure who is featured in all three films. The director offered Bloom the role a few weeks later</director>
      <director>only two days before the burgeoning star graduated from drama school. Legolas</director>
      <director>Tolkien's warrior elf</director>
      <director>has super-human strength</director>
      <director>swift reflexes</director>
      <director>and heightened sensory awareness. To play him</director>
      <director>Bloom trained in archery</director>
      <director>swordplay</director>
      <director>and horseback riding for two months prior to shooting. He developed a graceful style of combat based on the characters in Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai and worked to manage his posture</director>
      <director>poise</director>
      <director>and composure. As Legolas</director>
      <director>Bloom is immortal</director>
      <director>and at 2</director>
      <director>931 years old</director>
      <director>is a tall</director>
      <director>athletic</director>
      <director>and skilled fighter of evil -- he truly is larger than life. After finishing The Lord of the Rings -- all three films</director>
      <director>The Fellowship of the Ring</director>
      <director>The Two Towers</director>
      <director>and The Return of the King</director>
      <director>were shot simultaneously over 18 months in New Zealand -- Bloom headed to Morocco for a role in Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down. The film chronicles the horrific Battle of Mogadishu in 1993</director>
      <director>in which a "simple" mission left 18 U.S. soldiers dead and 73 wounded. Debuting his American accent</director>
      <director>Bloom plays a neophyte ranger who breaks his back after falling 70 feet from a helicopter. This combat film opened only a few weeks after The Fellowship of the Ring and received equal acclaim. Following these blockbusters</director>
      <director>Bloom performed in several quirky films with limited releases such as Lullaby of Clubland (2001). But it wouldn't be long before Bloom was blowing up the box-office once again with the 2003 crowd-pleaser The Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Bloom showed up opposite Brad Pitt and Black Hawk Dawn costar Eric Bana in the 2004 historical epic Troy</director>
      <director>his intense star-power was unquestionable.Bloom faced a down year in 2005</director>
      <director>failing to match the box office success of Troy with Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven. That same year he stepped into the role once occupied by Ashton Kutcher in Cameron Crowe's Elizabethtown</director>
      <director>but the film never recovered from the bad press it received after its initial film festival screening</director>
      <director>failed to find an audience in theaters</director>
      <director>and was unpopular with critics. Bloom rebounded one year later by returning with the other principles in back-to-back filmed sequels for Pirates of the Caribbean</director>
      <director>the first of which</director>
      <director>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</director>
      <director>shattered box office records for opening day and opening weekend</director>
      <director>and became the first film to take in one hundred million dollars in just two days. It will hardly strike one as prescient</director>
      <director>then</director>
      <director>that industry insiders and the trades were advance prepping Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End as one of the most lucrative releases of 2007</director>
      <director>possibly of any year. The actor would appear in more down tempo projects in the coming years</director>
      <director>like 2010's Main Street</director>
      <director>and 2011's The Good Doctor</director>
      <director>before hopping on board another swashbuckler</director>
      <director>playing the Duke of Buckhingham in The Three Musketeers. Though the film wasn't a huge success in the States</director>
      <director>Bloom would have another franchise ticket to cash in the following year</director>
      <director>reprising the role of elf Legolas in the Lord of the Rings prequel The Hobbit.      Peter O'Toole     Diane Kruger</director>

    <title lang="en">Einstein And Eddington</title>
    <desc lang="en">Einstein and Eddington depicts the unlikely partnership that developed during World War I between a young British scientist named Arthur Eddington and a brilliant physicist who would soon be a world-renowned celebrity, Albert Einstein. Not merely a retelling of the history surrounding Einstein's discovery of the Theory of Relativity, the film profiles the public and private challenges faced by both men during the beginning of the modern age, and shows how without Eddington's support, Einstein might never have risen to iconic status. Through their collaboration, Einstein, a theoretician who refused to play by the rules, and Eddington, a quiet Quaker full of purpose, turned Newton's ideas about the order of the universe inside out. Theirs was to become a long-distance partnership, viewed by many as unpatriotic and undertaken at great personal risk, that would change the course of modern science forever. And their story is one that impacts how we live, and view the universe, today.</desc>

      <director>Pitt remained supremely busy. He delivered a funny lead performance as Lt. Aldo Raine in Quentin Tarantino's blistering World War II saga Inglourious Basterds (2009)</director>

      <director>cerebral phantasmorgia on the meaning of life and death that became one of the critical sensations of the year. He also won a great deal of praise for his turn as Billy Beane in Bennett Miller's adaptation of the non-fiction book Moneyball</director>

      <director>United States    Trivia:  An actor whose remarkable versatility has often been described as chameleon-like</director>
      <director>Kevin Spacey has made an art of portraying a gallery of morally ambiguous characters ranging from the mildly shady to the all-out murderous. His reputation as one of the best-respected actors of his generation was bolstered by an Oscar</director>
      <director>a Tony</director>
      <director>and an award as Best Actor of the Decade from England's Empire magazine in 1999.The son of a technical procedure writer and a secretary</director>

      <director>NJ</director>
      <director>on July 26</director>
      <director>1959. His family moved a great deal thanks to his father's job</director>
      <director>eventually settling for a time in Los Angeles. It was there that Spacey -- who had previously done a stint at military school -- attended Chatsworth High School</director>
      <director>where he was very active in the theater. After an attempt at standup comedy</director>
      <director>Spacey went to Juilliard</director>
      <director>though his time was cut short after his second year</director>
      <director>when he decided to quit school and begin his career.He made his theatrical debut in 1981 with Shakespeare in the Park</director>
      <director>performing alongside the likes of Mandy Patinkin and John Goodman. The actor continued to be a fixture on the theater scene throughout the decade</director>
      <director>performing both on Broadway and in regional productions. It was through the theater that he got his first big break: While auditioning for a Tom Stoppard play</director>
      <director>Spacey was approached by director Mike Nichols</director>
      <director>who cast him in his production of David Rabe's Hurlyburly. The actor's work in the play led Nichols to cast him as a subway mugger in his 1986 Heartburn. Two years later</director>
      <director>the director and actor worked together again in Working Girl</director>
      <director>in which Spacey had a small but memorable role as a sleazy businessman.By this time</director>
      <director>Spacey was starting to work steadily in film</director>
      <director>although he maintained his stage work</director>
      <director>winning a 1990 Tony Award for his role in the Broadway production of Lost in Yonkers. He also did a substantial amount of television work</director>
      <director>appearing on the series Wiseguy as deranged criminal Mel Proffitt. Criminal or morally questionable activities were to figure largely in Spacey's subsequent portrayals: His first starring role in a film was as the husband of a murdered woman in the 1992 Consenting Adults. The same year</director>
      <director>he won acclaim for his portrayal of a foul-mouthed</director>
      <director>leech-like real estate agent in James Foley's screen adaptation of the David Mamet play</director>
      <director>Glengarry Glen Ross. Spacey landed his next memorable film role as yet another foul-mouthed jerk in the 1994 Swimming With Sharks</director>
      <director>which he also co-produced. He was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for his portrayal of an abusive studio executive</director>
      <director>and he gained further recognition the same year for his entirely different role in The Ref</director>
      <director>in which he played one half of a constantly arguing married couple. However</director>
      <director>it was with his performance in the following year's The Usual Suspects that Spacey fully stepped into the spotlight. As the enigmatic</director>
      <director>garrulous "Verbal" Kint</director>
      <director>Spacey was one of the more celebrated aspects of the critically lauded sleeper hit</director>
      <director>winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work. The actor won additional acclaim the same year for his role as a serial killer in the stylish and unrelentingly creepy thriller Seven. Spacey went on to make his directorial debut the following year with Albino Alligator. A New Orleans-based crime drama starring Matt Dillon</director>
      <director>Faye Dunaway</director>
      <director>and Gary Sinise</director>
      <director>the film won some positive reviews</director>
      <director>though it made little impact at the box office. In addition to directing</director>
      <director>Spacey kept busy with acting</director>
      <director>appearing the same year in A Time to Kill and Al Pacino's documentary Looking for Richard. The actor went on to star in Clint Eastwood's highly anticipated 1997 adaptation of John Berendt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and then had a sizable role in the big-budget The Negotiator in 1998. The same year</director>
      <director>he also lent his voice to the computer-animated A Bug's Life and starred in the screen adaptation of Hurlyburly. While doing steady film work</director>
      <director>Spacey also continued to appear on the stage</director>
      <director>winning raves for his performance in an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh</director>
      <director>first on the London stage in 1998</director>
      <director>and then on Broadway the following year. Also in 1999</director>
      <director>Spacey won an Academy Award as Best Actor for American Beauty</director>
      <director>director Sam Mendes' dark comedy about a man experiencing a mid-life crisis. Following up Beauty with starring roles in The Big Kahuna and Ordinary Decent Criminal</director>
      <director>Spacey would later appear as a mental patient who claims to be from a distant planet in K-PAX. K-Pax proved to be a minor flop</director>
      <director>as did the actor's other major film in 2001</director>

      <director>appearing in three disparate projects that reflected his extraordinary versatility. Besides cropping up as himself in the third Austin Powers outing</director>
      <director>Austin Powers: Goldmember</director>
      <director>he played the title character of The Life of David Gale</director>
      <director>the story of a University of Texas professor whose anti-capital punishment stance assumes very personal meaning when he is convicted of rape and murder and lands on death row; the picture received a critical drubbing and faded quickly from view. That year</director>
      <director>Spacey also starred in The United States of Leland</director>
      <director>playing the father of a fifteen-year-old (Ryan Gosling) who murders an autistic child.2004 marked a key year for Spacey. The actor -- who had dreamed of portraying crooner Bobby Darin since childhood</director>
      <director>and spent years striving to produce a biopic of the late singer through his production house</director>
      <director>Trigger Horse Productions</director>
      <director>ultimately realized that goal in December '04. In addition to starring Spacey as Darin</director>
      <director>the biopic</director>
      <director>entitled Beyond the Sea</director>
      <director>enlisted Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee</director>
      <director>John Goodman as Steve Blauner</director>
      <director>and Brenda Blethyn as Polly Cassotto. Beyond earned a decidedly mixed critical reception.In 2005</director>
      <director>Spacey cut back on his acting schedule and devoted more attention to his role as artistic director of the legendary Old Vic Theatre in London -- a position he had assumed in 2003</director>
      <director>under ten-year contract. In a Charlie Rose appearance c. 2005</director>
      <director>the actor openly discussed his desire to use his position to revive a series of theatrical classics and reestablish The Vic as one of the world's premier stage venues. Unfortunately</director>
      <director>Spacey's work here also earned some derision; under his aegis</director>
      <director>The Vic mounted Arthur Miller's Resurrection Blues in May 2006 - an effort helmed by Robert Altman - and it drew vicious critical pans</director>
      <director>one from a reviewer who demanded that Spacey resign. Although Spacey listened to the complaints about the Altman effort</director>
      <director>(shelving the production during the theater's busy summer tourist season)</director>
      <director>he vowed to continue his efforts at the Vic unabated.Summer 2006 also saw the actor appearing in the highly anticipated big-budget extravaganza Superman Returns</director>
      <director>playing Lex Luthor to Brandon Routh's Superman/Clark Kent and Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane. With a powerhouse supporting cast that includes Frank Langella (Good Night</director>
      <director>and Good Luck.)</director>
      <director>and Eva Marie Saint (North by Northwest)</director>
      <director>the picture predictably opened up to spectacular box office (becoming one of summer's top grossers) and enthusiastic critical notices. Those who did criticize the film singled out Spacey's interpretation of the Luthor role.About a month prior to the Superman debut</director>
      <director>Spacey signed with Warner Brothers to co-star in Joe Claus (originally titled Fred Claus)</director>
      <director>a Christmas comedy that reteamed Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin with funnyman Vince Vaughn</director>
      <director>and enlisted Paul Giamatti (American Splendor</director>
      <director>Sideways) as a co-star. Additional roles in the years that followed further reflected Spacey's penchant for the offbeat</director>
      <director>such as his portrayal of an envious military man caught up in psychic phenomena in the satire The Men Who Stare at Goats (2009)</director>
      <director>corrupt lobbyist Jack Abramoff in the acerbic comedy Casino Jack (2010) and a sadistic boss with a taste for humiliation in Horrible Bosses (2011). Meanwhile</director>
      <director>at about the same time</director>
      <director>Spacey took on the role of one of Shakespeare's most iconic villains in the Old Vic's production of Richard III - for which he earned considerable critical praise. In 2013</director>
      <director>Spacey returned to television on Netflix's House of Cards</director>
      <director>playing ruthless congressman Frank Underwood</director>
      <director>earning Spacey nominations from the Emmys</director>

      <director>Dolly! in 1968. He went on to have a successful career both on and off-Broadway</director>
      <director>showcasing his talents in everything from musicals to contemporary drama to Shakespeare. Before studying acting</director>

      <director>but in 1980</director>
      <director>he earned critical acclaim for his work in the prison drama Brubaker. He gained additional recognition for his work on the small screen with a regular role on the daytime drama Days of Our Lives from 1982 to 1984. Following Brubaker</director>
      <director>Freeman's subsequent '80s film work was generally undistinguished until he played the dangerously emotional pimp in Street Smart (1987) and earned his first Oscar nomination. With the success of Street Smart</director>
      <director>Freeman's film career duly took off and he appeared in a string of excellent films that began with the powerful Clean and Sober (1988) and continued with Driving Miss Daisy (1989)</director>
      <director>in which Freeman reprised his Obie-winning role of a dignified</director>
      <director>patient Southern chauffeur and earned his second Oscar nomination for his efforts. In 1989</director>
      <director>he also played a tough and cynical gravedigger who joins a newly formed regiment of black Union soldiers helmed by Matthew Broderick in Glory. The acclaim he won for that role was replicated with his portrayal of a high school principal in that same year's Lean on Me.Freeman constitutes one of the few African-American actors to play roles not specifically written for African-Americans</director>
      <director>as evidenced by his work in such films as Kevin Costner's Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991)</director>
      <director>in which he played Robin's sidekick</director>
      <director>and Clint Eastwood's revisionist Western Unforgiven (1992). In 1993</director>
      <director>Freeman demonstrated his skills on the other side of the camera</director>
      <director>making his directorial debut with Bopha!</director>
      <director>the story of a South African cop alienated from his son by apartheid. The following year</director>
      <director>the actor received a third Oscar nomination as an aged lifer in the prison drama The Shawshank Redemption. He went on to do steady work throughout the rest of the decade</director>
      <director>turning in memorable performances in films like Seven (1995)</director>
      <director>in which he played a world-weary detective; Amistad (1997)</director>
      <director>which featured him as a former slave; Kiss the Girls (1997)</director>
      <director>a thriller in which he played a police detective; and Deep Impact</director>
      <director>a 1998 blockbuster that cast Freeman as the President of the United States. Following an appearance opposite Renee Zellweger in director Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty</director>
      <director>Freeman would return to the role of detective Alex Cross in the Kiss the Girls sequel Along Came a Spider (2001). Freeman continued to keep a high profile moving into the new millennium with roles in such thrillers as The Sum of All Fears (2002) and Stephen King's Dreamcatcher</director>
      <director>and the popular actor would average at least two films per year through 2004. 2003's Jim Carrey vehicle Bruce Almighty cast Freeman as God (a tall role indeed</director>
      <director>and one he inherited from both George Burns and Gene Hackman). The story finds the Supreme Being appearing on Earth and giving Carrey temporary control over the universe - to outrageous comic effect. By the time Freeman appeared opposite Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood in Eastwood's acclaimed 2004 boxing drama Million Dollar Baby</director>
      <director>his reputation as one of Hollywood's hardest-working</director>
      <director>most-respected actors was cemented in place. When Freeman took home the Best Supporting Actor Oscar at the 77th Annual Academy Awards for his performance as the former boxer turned trainer who convinces his old friend to take a scrappy female fighter (Hilary Swank) under his wing</director>
      <director>the award was considered overdue given Freeman's impressive body of work.The Oscar reception lifted Freeman to further heights. In summer 2005</director>
      <director>Freeman was involved in three of the biggest blockbusters of the year</director>
      <director>including War of the Worlds</director>
      <director>Batman Begins and March of the Penguins. He joined the cast of the first picture as the foreboding narrator who tells of the destruction wrought by aliens upon the Earth. The Batman Begins role represented the first in a renewed franchise (the second being 2008's The Dark Knight)</director>
      <director>with the actor playing Lucius Fox</director>
      <director>a technology expert who equips Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) with his vast assemblage of gadgetry. Freeman also provided narration for the most unpredictable smash of the year</director>
      <director>the nature documentary March of the Penguins.That fall</director>
      <director>Miramax's drama An Unfinished Life cast Freeman in a difficult role as Mitch</director>
      <director>a bear attack victim reduced to near-paraplegia</director>
      <director>living on a derelict western ranch. The picture was shelved for two years; it arrived in cinemas practically stillborn</director>
      <director>and many critics turned their noses up at it. After a brutal turn as a sociopathic mob boss in Paul McGuigan's Lucky Number Slevin (2006)</director>
      <director>Freeman reprised his turn as God in the 2007 Bruce Almighty sequel Evan Almighty; the high-budgeted picture flopped</director>
      <director>but Freeman emerged unscathed. Versatile as ever</director>
      <director>he then opted for a much different genre and tone with a key role in the same year's detective thriller Gone</director>
      <director>Baby</director>
      <director>Gone. As written and directed by Ben Affleck (and adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane) the film wove the tale of two detectives searching for a missing four-year-old in Boston's underbelly. He returned to the Batman franchise in The Dark Knight</director>
      <director>a film that broke box-office records</director>
      <director>in 2008</director>
      <director>and he would stick with the franchise for its final installment</director>
      <director>The Dark Knight Rises</director>
      <director>in 2012. Freeman would remain a top tier actor in years to come</director>
      <director>appearing in such films as Red</director>
      <director>Invictus (which saw him playing Nelson Mandela)</director>
      <director>Conan the Barbarian</director>
      <director>and The Magic of Belle Isle.      Richard Roundtree (Actor)     Born:  July 09</director>
      <director>1942 in New Rochelle</director>
      <director>New York</director>
      <director>United States    Trivia:  Blaxploitation superstar Richard Roundtree earned screen immortality during the 1970s as the legendary Shaft</director>
      <director>"the black private dick that's the sex machine to all the chicks." Born July 9</director>
      <director>1942</director>
      <director>in New Rochelle</director>
      <director>NY</director>
      <director>Roundtree attended college on a football scholarship but later gave up athletics to pursue an acting career. After touring as a model with the Ebony Fashion Fair</director>
      <director>he joined the Negro Ensemble Company's acting workshop program in 1967. He made his film debut in 1970's What Do You Say to a Naked Lady?</director>
      <director>but was still an unknown when filmmaker Gordon Parks Sr. cast him as Shaft. The role shot Roundtree to instant fame</director>
      <director>launching the blaxploitation genre and proving so successful at the box office that it helped save MGM from the brink of bankruptcy. Thanks to the film's popularity -- as well as its two sequels</director>
      <director>1972's Shaft's Big Score! and the following year's Shaft in Africa</director>
      <director>and even a short-lived television series -- Roundtree became an icon of '70s-era cool</director>
      <director>and his image graced countless magazine covers. Outside of the Shaft franchise</director>
      <director>he also appeared in films including the 1974 disaster epic Earthquake</director>
      <director>1975's Man Friday</director>
      <director>and the blockbuster 1977 TV miniseries Roots. By the end of the decade</director>
      <director>however</director>
      <director>the blaxploitation movement was a thing of the past</director>
      <director>and Roundtree's stardom waned; apart from the 1981 big-budget flop Inchon</director>
      <director>he spent the 1980s appearing almost exclusively in TV roles or low-rent</director>
      <director>direct-to-video features. Still</director>
      <director>he continued working steadily</director>
      <director>and in 1995 appeared in David Fincher's smash thriller Seven. The following year he co-starred in the acclaimed Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored</director>
      <director>and also teamed with fellow blaxploitation vets Pam Grier and Fred "the Hammer" Williamson in Original Gangstas. In 1997</director>
      <director>Roundtree returned to series television in 413 Hope St.</director>

On the warmest day of the year, the country estate takes on an unsettling hothouse atmosphere, stoking Briony's vivid imagination. Robbie Turner, the educated son of the family's housekeeper, carries a torch for Briony's headstrong older sister Cecilia. Cecilia, he hopes, has comparable feelings; all it will take is one spark for this relationship to combust. When it does, Briony - who has a crush on Robbie - is compelled to interfere, going so far as accusing Robbie of a crime he did not commit. Cecilia and Robbie declare their love for each other, but he is arrested - and with Briony bearing false witness, the course of three lives is changed forever. Briony continues to seek forgiveness for her childhood misdeed. Through a terrible and courageous act of imagination, she finds the path to her uncertain atonement, and to an understanding of the power of enduring love.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Episode 3</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The outback is one of the world's last wild frontiers. It's vast, untamed and home to some of the toughest to reach places on Earth. For the giant trucks who roam this epic, harsh country, there's only one way to get from A to B - the hard way. Whether it's taking on scorching deserts, battling torrential rains that turn roads into rivers, or braving a continent's worth of brutal bitumen and desolate dirt... this is a land that can destroy trucks and truckers in a heartbeat. But for the men and women who risk their rigs and their lives to face it, this punishing wilderness is a home from home. In Outback Truckers Season 3, we hit the road train again, for a whole new season of dirt, dramas and dangers, joining some of the toughest, most skilled truckers on the planet, as they haul their massive loads through hell on Earth. Without them, Australia would grind to a halt. Their mission: to get their freight in and their trucks out. In this episode, Matt Adams faces a rough ride, and the Stephens brothers battle bogs to rescue their haul. Later, Macca McReady runs into trouble with a valuable load.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The outback is one of the world's last wild frontiers and for the giant trucks who roam this epic, harsh country, there's only one way to get from A to B - the hard way. Whether it's taking on scorching deserts, or battling torrential rains that turn roads into rivers... this is a land that can destroy in a heartbeat. For the men and women who risk their rigs and their lives to face it, this punishing wilderness is a home away from home. In this new season, we hit the road train again for lots of dirt and dangers, joining some of the toughest, most skilled truckers on the planet, as they haul their massive loads through hell on Earth. Without them, Australia would grind to a halt. Their mission: to get their freight in and their trucks out. In this episode, Tanker driver Sludge tries to dodge disaster, while Steve Graham suffers from his worst nightmare on the road. Rough weather places Macca McReady in jeopardy.</desc>

Dan and Laura Dotson take over for the second half of the season in their usual hyper-energetic style that viewers have gotten accustomed to since the inception of the show. On the buying end, we bring back the regulars: Dave Hester stirs things up from the start; Darrell Sheets shows off his recent weight loss and brings along an eager (if unprepared) pupil; while Brandi Passante and Jarrod Schulz, having sold their store, are forced to approach the business from a different angle. Rene Nezhoda hits the ground running, nailing a HUGE vintage video game locker and showing that he's still a major player. Ivy Calhoun keeps grinding, buying locker after locker, working economies of scale to his advantage. Mary Padian is as feisty as ever, holding her own against the competition. Rounding out the bidders this season is long time fan favourite Kenny Crossley, who brings his unique hilarious twist as a bidder in his own right.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Episode 5</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The outback is one of the world's last wild frontiers. It's vast, untamed and home to some of the toughest to reach places on Earth. For the giant trucks who roam this epic, harsh country, there's only one way to get from A to B - the hard way. Whether it's taking on scorching deserts, battling torrential rains that turn roads into rivers, or braving a continent's worth of brutal bitumen and desolate dirt... this is a land that can destroy trucks and truckers in a heartbeat. But for the men and women who risk their rigs and their lives to face it, this punishing wilderness is a home from home. In Outback Truckers Season 3, we hit the road train again, for a whole new season of dirt, dramas and dangers, joining some of the toughest, most skilled truckers on the planet, as they haul their massive loads through hell on Earth. Without them, Australia would grind to a halt. Their mission: to get their freight in and their trucks out. In this episode, Two concrete specialists go off the map and get into trouble, while Yogi runs out of road.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This series opens with a gravity defying three storey tree house in Gloucestershire, built by two nature lovers determined to live life high up in the branches. To follow there's a giant house of fun near Horsham, complete with secret doorways and hidden passages. There are twin 21st century farm buildings in Devon and a unique home on the edge of the Lancashire moors inspired by drystone walls. Hidden away in an Essex woodland there's a sleek black bunker like home designed for an artist, and in rural Pembrokeshire a hand crafted recycled house built for less than thirty thousand pounds. And that's not forgetting the astonishing Cornish home made with beautiful flowing steam bent ash. Kevin McCloud is on hand to witness all the twists and turns experienced by those willing to put everything on the line to build their once in a lifetime homes.</desc>
